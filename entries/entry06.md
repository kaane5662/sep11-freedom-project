# Entry 6
The Reflection 6/2


## About

As of now I have fully presented my MVP to the class and to the expo. This entry is to reflect on the scores the judges gave based on my [elevator pitch](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Cur3qpqJhUfzkvE5os3QYdu-7uHc-YeyUuqJXg6y9jQ/edit) and MVP, and to consider my overall [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/145qoGyJujCYushJ5XC9N0S_cIZV6e-Eh_yQElVwaBQM/edit).


## Judges Ratings

### Creativity

The judges have rated me a 2.5 on Creativity for my MVP. At first I thought that was ridiculous, since my MVP innovated the current concept of a schedule by making customization the main focus. However, after careful looking I realized the flaw with my creativity. I realized that my project was actually not fully original because schedules with far more advanced customization already exist, so mine wasn't really innovating anything. Actually my MVP was downgrading the current concept, making a schedule look like a cheap cash grab.

### Usability

The judges have rated me a 3 on Usability for my MVP. To be honest, I was expecting a lower score, because my goals were definitley not hit for usability. In order to use my schedule, there are 2 sites you need to use: input.html(where you input what you want for your schedule) and output.html(the preview of your current input). Not only that, but I had no instructions to use this MVP, and with already difficult navigation, usability goes far below expectations. My goal next time is to not give up and figure out how to fit the input and output on one page so the user doesn't have to constantly switch between the two. The reason why I initially gave up on this was because I could not figure the event listeners out.

### Enjoyability

The product is very enjoyable to use when you figure out how to properly navigate it, which is why I got 3.5 for this section. The batch of customization options pushed more to playing with the theme of the schedule, rather than actually creating one. However, I personally believe that customization was lacking some stuff. I initially wanted to add fade backgrounds as well as let it be so the user can upload images as backgrounds, but never caught up to it. Nevertheless, still quite enjoyable.

### Presentation

To be honest, I did not memorize my elevator pitch, which is probably why the judges gave me a 3/4, but I can assure you if I did my presentation would score less. My elevator pitch sounds way to formal and makes me sound like a walking advertisement begging others to use my product, despite being non-profit(so far). So, I tried to just be human and just freely talk to the judge about my project without letting any limitations be in my way. Consequently, too much freedom led me to not follow some parts of the rubric, such as responding to some follow up questions with some negligence.


## Presentation Main Struggles

### Hook

To be honest, my hook was actually pretty good mainly because it was relatable. However, the hook itself wasn't the issue, it was the timing of the hook. You see, my hook was placed after the introduction of my project tools, which is a huge mistake. Instead, the hook should be placed RIGHT AFTER the title slide in an attempt to lure the audience in, which I was unsuccessful at doing. Next time, I am gonna do exactly just that, hook after the title slide.

### Conclusion

Yes, I agree that my conclusion was offputting because it was more about my mental takeaways than my actual reflections from this project. I mainly talked about mental challenges, such as paitence and preserverance, instead of my actual summaries of the project. Next time I will talk about interesting concepts I learned from Firebase that can be applied to future concepts.

### Presence

I agree that my engagement with my viewers was lacking, especially in terms of eye contact, but I was able to get some eye contact. After the nuking of my planned presentation with the video not working, I wanted to quit the presentation all together as I have lost all hope. You see, I am not prepared to handle situations in which something goes wrong on a presentation. Next time, I should prepare for the worse and not give up hope, and continue with my presentation. As a result, I can be more confident with engaging with my audience and showing more eye contact.




## EDP

I am currently in stage 8 of the engineering design process: communicate the results. Basically right now, after reflecting on the judges and my presentation, I am considering how can I improvise for my next freedom project. I am writing down this advice on a seperate document and communicating with certain peers from SEP to get some criticism. I hope that next time I can be more prepared and present a better product.
## Skills

Regarding skills, I think Iâ€™m growing in "embracing failure". Taking all my flaws into hand, I have to say I am glad to face these. Now for my future presentations I know what criticism to take into hand and I am ready to prepare for even the most negative consequences. Now I know that a hook should come after the title slide. Now I know that an elevator pitch should not have to much freedom and follow some guidelines. Now I am ready to face the worse technical errors and still look ahead to continue my presentation.
